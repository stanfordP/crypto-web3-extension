# Beta Tester's Guide: CTJ Web3 Extension

Thank you for helping us test the **CTJ Web3 Authentication Bridge**. Since the extension is currently in the Chrome Web Store review process, you will need to install it manually using "Developer Mode".

## 🛠️ Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Download & Extract
1. Download the latest `ctj-web3-extension-vX.X.X.zip` from our [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/...) page.
2. Extract the file into a folder you plan to keep. **Do not delete or move this folder after installation**, or the extension will stop working.

### Step 2: Enable Developer Mode
1. Open Google Chrome.
2. Type `chrome://extensions` in the address bar and press **Enter**.
3. In the top-right corner, toggle the **Developer mode** switch to **ON**.

### Step 3: Load the Extension
1. Click the **Load unpacked** button that appeared in the top-left.
2. Select the folder where you extracted the extension files (the folder containing `manifest.json`).
3. You should now see "Crypto Trading Journal - Web3 Auth" in your list of extensions.

## 💡 What to Expect (Beta Limitations)

*   **Startup Warning**: Every time you start Chrome, you may see a message saying "Disable developer mode extensions." Please click **"Keep"** or the "X" to close it. This is a standard Chrome security feature.
*   **Manual Updates**: This version will **not** update automatically. We will notify you when a new ZIP is available.
*   **MetaMask Required**: For the best experience, ensure you have MetaMask installed. Our extension acts as a "Bridge" and requires an underlying wallet provider.
