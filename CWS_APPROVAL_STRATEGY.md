---

## Executive Summary

This document consolidates all findings from the rejection analysis and provides a prioritized action plan for successful Chrome Web Store approval.

---

## 1. Root Cause Analysis

### Why We Were Rejected

| Issue | Impact | How Reviewers Experience It |
|-------|--------|----------------------------|
| **"Wallet" terminology** | Critical | Reviewers expect balance/send features like MetaMask |
| **No MetaMask installed** | Critical | Extension appears "broken" on fresh Chrome profile |
| **500-char limit** | High | Can't explain multi-extension dependency |
| **No visual proof** | High | Extension looks non-functional until full flow complete |
| **Main site dependency** | High | If site is down/slow, extension "doesn't work" |

### Key Insight

> Chrome reviewers test on **fresh Chrome profiles** with **no other extensions**. If your extension requires another extension (MetaMask), you must make this dependency crystal clear in the **first line** of test instructions.

| 5 | CWS privacy disclosures match policy | Submission | Cross-check with PRIVACY.md |

## 4. CWS Submission Field Reference

### Permission Justifications

**Storage:**
> "Stores encrypted session tokens locally for cross-tab authentication persistence. Session data never synced to cloud. Used only on cryptotradingjournal.xyz."

**ActiveTab:**
> "Detects when user navigates to cryptotradingjournal.xyz to enable wallet authentication flow. No browsing data is collected or stored."

**Alarms:**
> "Maintains Service Worker keep-alive during SIWE signing. MV3 service workers terminate after 30 seconds; signing can take longer when users read authentication messages carefully. Alarms fire only during active auth flows."

**Host Permissions (cryptotradingjournal.xyz):**
> "Content script runs exclusively on cryptotradingjournal.xyz to inject the wallet bridge code. No other domains are accessed."

### Privacy Practices Checklist

| CWS Field | Check? | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Authentication info | ✅ | Wallet address, session tokens |
| Personally identifiable info | ❌ | Not collected |
| Health info | ❌ | Not applicable |
| Financial info | ❌ | No balances/transactions accessed |
| Location | ❌ | Not collected |
| Web history | ❌ | Not collected |
| User activity | ❌ | Only auth events |

## 5. Test Flow for Reviewers

### The "Golden Path" (Must Work Flawlessly)

```
1. Reviewer installs MetaMask
   └── Uses standard test seed: abandon×11 + about

2. Reviewer installs this extension
   └── Clicks extension icon → sees status indicators

3. Reviewer visits https://cryptotradingjournal.xyz/login
   └── Page loads in <3 seconds, "Connect Wallet" visible

4. Reviewer clicks "Connect Wallet"
   └── MetaMask popup appears immediately

5. Reviewer approves connection in MetaMask
   └── Site shows "Signing in..." or similar loading state

6. Reviewer signs SIWE message in MetaMask
   └── Clear, readable message with domain verification

7. Authentication completes
   └── User redirected to dashboard or success page

8. Reviewer clicks extension icon
   └── Shows "Connected" with wallet address

✅ SUCCESS: Extension approved
```

### Failure Points to Eliminate

| Failure Point | Cause | Prevention |
|---------------|-------|------------|
| "Extension not working" | MetaMask not installed | Status indicator + install link |
| "Nothing happens" | Site not responding | Loading states, error messages |
| "Can't connect" | CAPTCHA/bot protection | Whitelist reviewer IPs or disable |
| "Timeout" | Service worker died | Keep-alive alarms |
| "Signature failed" | User didn't see popup | Explicit "Check MetaMask" message |
